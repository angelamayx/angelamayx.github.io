                    Given an image, this program will detect the faces
                    present in it. The system was 
                    first trained on both positive features (6,713 
                    images of faces) and negative features (20k images 
                    of things that were not faces). Every image in each 
                    features set was converted to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients"
                    class="hoverlink" target="_blank">HoG</a> map. The
                    sets of HoG maps were used train a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine"
                    class="hoverlink" target="_blank">support vector
                    machine (SVM)</a>. After converting an image to a 
                    HoG map, the program uses sliding windows at
                    different scales, checking the content inside the
                    window with the SVM. If a face seems to be detected,
                    a vote will be casted for that window. After running
                    the sliding window, the program will use non-maximum
                    suppression to decide the best centers for each 
                    detected face.

                    Given an image, this program will detect the faces

                    of things that were not faces). Every image in each

                	material but he actually did. Implementing virtual 
                	memory involved creating page tables and page 
                	directories as well as manipulating registers.

                	single-cycle processor into a multi-cycle processor 
                	to allow for pipelining and reading from memory.

                	series of actions involving the stack or variables. 
                	The interpretor translated the instructions into 
                	Assembly created the illusion of variables using

                	This project consisted of multiple parts that led to
                	being a search engine applet. The first part was a 
                	webcrawler. Given a URL from a dummy internet, the 
                	webcrawler will parse through the webpage's HTML, 
                	saving the page's content to a database and 
                	searching for links. The found links will be add to a
                	queue, and the webcrawler use the queue to find pages
                	it has yet to visit. The database was an inverted 
                	index where each word found in the internet was a key
                	and its value was a list of its found locations (URL
                	and index into page). To query the database, a user
                	can type queries into the search engine applet using
                	a query language. A query parser seperated the query
                	into keywords and symbols and then queried
                	the database accordingly, returning relevant web 
                	results.

                	value. which determines the node's placement if the 
                	treap was a BST, and a randomly generated id, which
                	determines the node's placement if the treap was a 
                	heap. The treap also allowed for a user to add or
                	remove nodes.

                	arranged and oriented at the beginning of the game.
                	The program will then use breadth-first search and a 
                	prefix trie built from the Linux dictionary to 
                	create a list of possible words. A user can then

                	also implemented logic sequences in the game such as

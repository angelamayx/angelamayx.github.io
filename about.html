            Hello, my name is Angela, and welcome to my website. Let me
            tell you a bit about myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, but spent my early childhood
            in Oxfordshire, England, and Hefei, China. At age 5, I moved
            with my family to The Woodlands, a surburb north of Houston, TX.
            As a kid, I enjoyed drawing, reading, and going on the internet.
            I started using the internet at a rather young age, and I first
            learned HTML while trying to edit my Neopets webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a giant nerd in high school, I took a lot of art and art
            history classes but also the two computer science classes my
            school offered and was a lab aide for computer science my senior
            year. I started college at The University of Texas at Austin in
            August 2014, majoring in <a class="hoverlink" 
            href="http://utexas.edu/cola/plan2"> Plan II Honors</a>
            and Computer Science (<a class="hoverlink"
            href="http://cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars">Turing Scholars
            Honors</a>). The summer after my freshman year, I had an
            internship at IBM working on Bluemix Guided Experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am in my second year, still at UT Austin. I'll be
            interning at Google next summer and most likely completing a 
            thesis in computer art next school year. At this time, I am
            trying to complete a 365-day streak on Github. Follow me
